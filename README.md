Traffic Incidents Data Warehouse Project
This repository contains the implementation of a Traffic Incidents Data Warehouse designed to analyze crash data in Chicago. The project simulates a decision support system for an insurance company, enabling the identification of high-risk areas, trends, and patterns in traffic incidents.


The main goal of this project is to transform raw traffic incident data into a structured data warehouse using the Star Schema design. The data is further processed using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for specific analytical tasks.
